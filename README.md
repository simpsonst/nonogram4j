# Purpose

This is a pluggable framework for line-by-line Nonogram solvers.
Plugin APIs exist for line solvers and line selectors, and maybe later for bifurcation selectors.
Some plugins are also provided, although a fast, comprehensive line solver is yet to be implemented.

[Some documentation](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/~simpsons/javadoc/nonogram4j/) might appear.
